##  There are 3 components to a Quarto document

1. the YML header:
    * YML = yet another markup language
    * can define table of contents, etc.
2. Prose aka text
    * we can make text **bold**
    * we can make text *italic*
    * and on and on
3. Code chunks.  There is where we code.  
    
## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r , echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
