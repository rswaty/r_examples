# Set a seed for reproducibility

# Create a vector of beetle names
beetle_names <- c("Ladybug", 
                  "Stag Beetle", 
                  "Firefly Beetle", "Dung Beetle", "Jewel Beetle")

# Create a vector of beetle lengths
beetle_lengths <- runif(20, 1, 5)  # Random lengths between 1 and 5
# the runif blah blah 

# Create a vector of beetle colors
beetle_colors <- sample(c("Red", "Black", "Green", "Yellow", "Blue"), 20, replace = TRUE)

# Create the random beetle dataframe
beetle_df <- data.frame(Name = sample(beetle_names, 20, replace = TRUE),
                        Length = beetle_lengths,
                        Color = beetle_colors)


# save this fake data to data directory-go slow
write.csv(beetle_df, file = "data/fake_beetle_data.csv")

### Make quick chart

length_chart <- barplot(height = beetle_df$Length, names = beetle_df$Name)
